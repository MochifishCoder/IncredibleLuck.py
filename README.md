# IncredibleLuck.py
My very first program, written in Python for Minecraft. It teleports the player 100 blocks in the air and places a slime block where they just were. I hope you like it.

To set up, you need Python 3.5.1, spigot, and Minecraft. Open a new folder in the python shell, copy the code and paste it in, and save it (put it anywhere you want). Open spigot, start the server, open Minecraft, join the server, and run the code. Enjoy! 

PS: If you can find another way to run this, tell me.

#[IMPORTANT] THIS PROJECT IS FINISHED, SO NO MORE UPDATES WILL COME TO IT.
